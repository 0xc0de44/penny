# [DEV IN PROGRESS] penny
This is my custom pentest library designed for pentest automation: port scan, vulnerability analysis, exploitation...
The first goal is to use widely used tools like NMAP and provide a better view on data I can get with these (correlating port scan and exploit database, formatting gathered data, saving / importing ...).

I'll provide more information about this later.
This project is now my main priority, since it will ease my vulnerability research in OSCP scope.
